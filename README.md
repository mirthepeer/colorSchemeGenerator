# Color Scheme Generator

A color scheme generator built using JavaScript. This project is a demonstration of my skills as a developer and my ability to work with JavaScript. The color scheme generator allows users to generate different color schemes based on their preference, providing a wide range of options to choose from. The color schemes can be generated by selecting a primary color, or by randomly generating a color scheme. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, and the color schemes are displayed in a visually pleasing format along with the hex code of the colors generated. I have used JavaScript to create the core functionality of the color scheme generator, and also to create the user interface. The project also uses CSS to make the interface look appealing. This feature makes it easy for developers to use the color schemes in their projects. Feel free to take a look and give me feedback.
